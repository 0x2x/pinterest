# pinterest image saver
``python image.py``


**how it works**
	The way the script works is by opening [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com)
	and logging in by typing the email and password from the strings into the email **ID** & password **ID** Then it would press "enter" as for all websites if you press enter it would click login (pretty much), Then script would wait for the redirection to happen then after send a screenshot of what the interface sees and uses a **JS (javascript)** function using the page.evaluate. After checking if their ads and stuff it would go through them each and save the file.
